## The Love Letter Mystery

James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to
his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle
with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into
palindromes.

To do this, he follows two rules:
1. He can only reduce the value of a letter by 1, i.e . he can
    change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.
2. The letter a may not be reduced any further.
 
Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single
operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to
convert a given string into a palindrome.

**Example**

s = cde

The following two operations are performed: cde → cdd → cdc.

Return 2
